            <h3>Reading forex charts is a vital skill every aspiring forex trader should learn. Live forex charts are available for free from many sources, including the popular MetaTrader platform and right here at ForexTraders. Forex charts show the exchange rate for two currencies and how that changes over time. These currency pairs are referred to with their respective 3-letter codes. The most popular currency pair, the Euro versus the US Dollar, is referred to as EUR/USD.</h3>

            <h3>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is responsible for assigning a three-letter code or symbol to every recognized global currency. The first two letters of the code are typically the two letters of ISO country codes. They are also used as the basis for national top-level domains on the Internet, and the third is usually the initial for the respective currency.</h3>

            <h3>Currency pairs are classified as Major, Minor, and Exotic. In the following article, you will learn about these classifications, how to access a free live chart for a chosen pairing, where to find more information on each forex pair, and lastly, what the basics are when it comes to reading live forex charts.</h3>

            <h1>Major Currency Pairs</h1>

            <h3>Major currency pairings involve the US Dollar with each of the other major currencies in the world – the EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, NZD, and CHF (Swiss Franc). Over 50% of the daily trades in the forex market involve the USD, and the EUR/USD pairing accounts for 30% of daily turnover. The AUD, NZD, and CAD are commodity currencies since each nation's economy heavily depends on its export trade. The JPY is also regarded as a commodity currency since Japan must import nearly all raw materials. Liquidity tends to be high for these pairings, but Bid/Ask spreads can vary to a degree.</h3>

            <h2>You can find explanations on each of the major currency pairs in forex, along with links to free forex charts and in-depth guides, below:</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>EUR/USD: Most popular major pair, highest daily turnover, best for beginners</li>
                <li>USD/JPY: Very stable over time. Yen resembles commodity currency due to imports</li>
                <li>GBP/USD: Sometimes called "Cable", heavy volume but more erratic than EUR/USD</li>
                <li>USD/CHF: The pairing of two Reserve currencies, the Swiss Franc is known for its stability</li>
                <li>AUD/USD: The "Aussie" is a commodity currency, heavily dependent on trade with China</li>
                <li>USD/CAD: The "Loonie" is a commodity currency, heavily reliant on oil prices</li>
                <li>NZD/USD: The "Kiwi" is a commodity currency, heavily dependent on agriculture exports</li>
